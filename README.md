# DGP-SEM_Pro

### Author:
Gyeongcheol Cho

## Description:
- The **DGP-SEM_Pro** package allows users to generate implied covariance matrices of indicators and simulate data from structural equation models (SEM) with factors and/or components. 

## Features:
- Derive implied covariance matrices from linear structural equation models with factors and/or components.
- Randomly generate data from the model for simulation purposes.
- **New in v1.1:** Support for generating data from SEM with **component interactions**.
- **New in v1.2:** Support for generating data from SEM with **higher-order constructs**.

## Installation:
To use this package in MATLAB:
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PsycheMatrica/DGP-SEM_Pro.git
   ```
2. Add the package to your MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('DGP-SEM_Pro'))
   ```

## Usage:
- To see examples of how to use the package, refer to the "Run_Example_...".m files. This file demonstrates how to derive implied covariance matrices and generate simulation data using the package.

## Compatibility:
- Tested on MATLAB R2023b.
- Likely compatible with earlier MATLAB versions.

### Future Update
- A version of this package will be released for R in the near future.
- More complex model structures will be accommodated.
